## Problem
We have been tasked by the DVD Rental Co marketing team to help them generate the analytical inputs required to drive their very first customer email campaign.
The marketing team expects their personalised emails to drive increased sales and engagement from the DVD Rental Co customer base. The main initiative is to share insights about each customer‚Äôs viewing behaviour to demonstrate DVD Rental Co‚Äôs relentless focus on customer experience. The insights requested by the marketing team include key statistics about each customer‚Äôs top 2 categories and favourite actor. There are also 3 personalised recommendations based off each customer‚Äôs previous viewing history as well as titles which are popular with other customers.
